# odin-recipes

This website is part of The Odin Project
I will be using this to demonstrate what I have learned about html so far.
I am not expecting to be able to do all this without referring to previous material but I am going to do as much as I can without having to refresh myself.

I think I have grasped the majority of concepts so far but a lot of it feels very confusing and scary

Wish me luck.
